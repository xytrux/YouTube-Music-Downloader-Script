## üç™ Using Cookies.txt (optional, recommended for private playlists)

To download from your **YouTube Music account (private playlists, liked songs, etc.):**

1. Export your YouTube cookies using a browser extension like [Get cookies.txt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/).
2. Save it anywhere as `cookies.txt`.
3. When running the script, it will **ask if you want to use a cookies file**:

   * If you answer **Y**, enter the full path to your `cookies.txt`.
   * Example:
     **Windows:** `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\cookies.txt`
     **Linux:** `/home/yourname/Downloads/cookies.txt`

If you don't use a cookies file, the script will still work for public playlists.
